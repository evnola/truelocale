The original translation is acceptable.\n- {{threshold_low}} – {{threshold_high}} : Meaningful nuance or tone difference. Further review may be required.\n- > {{threshold_high}} : High-risk error (wrong meaning, misleading localization, or potential user harm).\n\nYou MUST be conservative.\nIf you are uncertain, prefer escalation over confidence.\n\nOutput STRICT JSON only.",
